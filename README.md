# KAAL-The-voice-Assistant
KAAL is a Personal Voice Assistant built with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages libraries like SpeechRecognition, Pyttsx3, Pyaudio, and Tkinter to perform tasks such as voice-based search, automation, and offline music playback, offering an interactive and intelligent user experience.             

## ✨ Features
- 🎙️ **Speech Recognition & Text-to-Speech** – Understands voice commands and responds naturally.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Voice Input** → User speaks into the microphone.  
2. **Speech Recognition** → Converts voice to text using `SpeechRecognition`.  
3. **Command Processing** → Python processes the text and maps it to tasks (e.g., play music, open app, search).  
4. **Response** → Assistant responds via `pyttsx3` or updates the UI via JavaScript.
